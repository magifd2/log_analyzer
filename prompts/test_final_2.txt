You will receive a series of concise summaries, one per log chunk, concatenated into the placeholder `{chunk_summaries}`.  
Your task is to read all of them and produce a single, coherent report that addresses the user’s objective: **analyzing system stability, pinpointing root causes of critical errors, and offering actionable recommendations**.

Instructions for the report:

1. **Executive Summary** – Briefly state overall system health and any obvious stability issues detected across all logs.  
2. **Trend Analysis** – Identify recurring patterns, spikes in error rates, or time‑of‑day anomalies.  
3. **Root Cause Inference** – For each critical error or recurring issue, propose the most likely underlying cause(s), citing evidence from the chunk summaries.  
4. **Impact Assessment** – Describe how each root cause could affect system availability, performance, or data integrity.  
5. **Recommendations / Action Items** – Provide concrete steps to mitigate the identified root causes (e.g., configuration changes, resource scaling, code fixes, monitoring enhancements).  
6. **Prioritization** – Rank the recommendations by urgency or impact.  

Format the report in clear sections with headings, bullet points for action items, and concise explanations (no more than 2–3 sentences per point).  
Insert the concatenated chunk summaries in place of `{chunk_summaries}` and then write your final synthesis.  

**Final Summarization Prompt:**

> Analyze the following log chunk summaries and produce a single, high‑level report that:
>
> 1. Summarizes overall system stability and any obvious issues.
> 2. Highlights trends or recurring patterns across the logs.
> 3. Infers root causes of critical errors, citing evidence from the summaries.
> 4. Assesses the impact of each root cause on system performance and reliability.
> 5. Recommends concrete, actionable steps to address the root causes, prioritizing them by urgency or impact.
>
> Use clear headings and bullet points for recommendations.
