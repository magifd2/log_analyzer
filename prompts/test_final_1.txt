You are an expert log analyst.  
Below you will receive `{chunk_summaries}`, a concatenated list of concise summaries extracted from individual log chunks.  

**Your task:**

1. **Identify all CRITICAL errors** across the entire log set and list their exact timestamps.  
2. **Synthesize** the information to produce a single, high‑level report that:
   - Highlights overall trends and patterns in the error occurrences.  
   - Infers likely root causes for the CRITICAL errors based on context clues in the summaries.  
   - Provides concrete, actionable recommendations or next‑step actions to resolve or mitigate these issues.

**Output format:**  
- A brief introductory paragraph.  
- A bullet‑point list of CRITICAL error timestamps.  
- A section on trends & root‑cause insights.  
- A final section with clear, prioritized action items.

Ensure the report is concise yet comprehensive, suitable for a technical manager reviewing system stability.
