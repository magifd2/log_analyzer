Analyze the following log snippet and extract all occurrences of **CRITICAL** errors.  
For each CRITICAL error, provide the exact timestamp (as it appears in the log) and a brief one‑sentence description of the error type.  
Output a concise, structured list in plain text, one entry per line:

```
[TIMESTAMP] – ERROR_DESCRIPTION
```

If no CRITICAL errors are present, reply with `No CRITICAL errors found.`
